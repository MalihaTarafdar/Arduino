# Arduino

My Arduino projects. Most of these were for my Electronics and Robotics class during my sophomore year of high school.

## Piano
This uses a passive buzzer and 9 buttons to create a piano. The notes are C, D, E, F, G, A, B, in that order. It includes octaves 3-7. There is a button to increase the octave and one to decrease the octave. The frequencies of the notes at the starting octave (4) are stored. The frequencies of all the other notes are calculated using the frequencies of the notes in the starting octave.

## CubeSolver
This program is able to scramble and solve a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube. Six DC motors are used. The solving method is Layer by Layer with 4-look LL. 

## RGB_LED_with_button
Pressing the button toggles the state of the RGB LED, turing it on or off. When the RGB LED is on, it will gradually cycle through different colors. 

## Nightlight
This is the same as RGB_LED_with_buttons except instead of a button to turn the RGB LED on and off, there is a photoresistor to turn the LED on when the environment is dark enough. 

## FINAL_PROJECT

This was my final project for Electronics and Robotics. It is a home security system making use of LEDs, a speaker, a capacitive touch sensor, a motion sensor, a proximity sensor, and a switch. 

## car

This operates a simple car using 2 DC motors and a joystick. Made for a project in Electronics and Robotics.
